# Inbox for music
This is the default location to read new music from. 
New music will be *moved* from this dir to the library.
You should symlink this somewhere sensible, and ideally share it on the network too.
This should make it very easy to add new files.

Expected workflow is simply:
- drop files in the inbox
- run beet import to add them to the library
